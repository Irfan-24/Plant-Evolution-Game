This project is an interactive game that allows users to explore and learn about plant evolution. The game is designed to facilitate understanding of evolution and give users control over plant growth, allowing for endless play.

Inspired by an interest in plant evolution observed in biology coursework, this project aims to create a fun and engaging way for people to learn about the topic. The game is designed to be accessible to all ages and levels of expertise, from beginner to advanced.

The game is built using Python with a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to control the growth and evolution of their plant. Users can select from different plant species, each with unique characteristics, and grow and breed their plants to create new and more advanced species.

The game also includes educational elements, with pop-up boxes that provide information on plant evolution and related topics. These boxes appear at various points in the game, giving users the opportunity to learn as they play.

This project is open source and available on GitHub, with the aim of encouraging collaboration and contribution from the wider community. The game is designed to be scalable, with the potential for future development and expansion to include more plant species and additional features.

Overall, this project is a fun and interactive way to learn about plant evolution, with the potential to inspire and educate people of all ages and backgrounds.
